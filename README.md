# JS-Final-Project
# Description

This final JS project was created for the purpose of my two week Javascript class final exam, with professor [Aakash Malhotra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/aakash-malhotra) 🔗.

This project highlighted and improved my knowledge of API's, AJAX calls and the jQuery library 📚.

## 🚧🛠 Construction 🚧🛠
Currently trying to find a **free** solution to make my AccuWeather API call over HTTPS, as GitHub Pages doesn't handle HTTP requests. 

Please feel free to contribute if you think you have a solution, thank you!

The API call is made with the help of the jQuery syntax in JS-Final-Project/js/login.js, line 138. 

I tried putting this address (https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/) before the Accuweather address, as someone suggested on StackOverflow, but I wish there would be a better solution as it is still not working correctly. The temporary work around to use the project is explained in the Usage section, below ⬇️

## Usage

**Temporary** : go to https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com and click on the button to get temporary access to the server. Then, go to the GitHub page and follow the instructions below ⬇️
